      <h1 class="aboutme-header">About Me</h1>
      <p class="aboutme-text">I have been learning to code since January 2021, having always had an interest in how
        computers work.
        I began my coding journey by taking <a
          href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x" target="_blank">CS50x: Introduction to Computer
          Science</a> to see if I had the capability to work in programming
        and to see whether it suited me. I loved it and found myself unable to stop. Better still, I found I was really
        good at it.
        Since then I have completed several certificates on
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/henrygolding" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp</a> and am constantly striving to direct my
        learning to those areas where I can identify that I am less confident, and
        that will best serve to make me an exceptional coder. <br><br>I love new challenges and learning through projects and
        hands-on experience.
        To this end, in my spare time I continue to learn new skills and revise
        existing ones on <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/profile/21408898" target="_blank">Sololearn</a>, to think of and create
        new projects in the languages I want to improve my knowledge of, and to amuse myself whilst deepening my understanding by solving
        problems on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/tr130/completed" target="_blank">Codewars</a> and <a
          href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a>. Since March I've been a student on the Netmatters <a href="/scsscheme.html">Scion Coalition Scheme</a>
          where I am continuing to enhance my knowledge base with the goal of becoming a Full Stack web developer.                

        <h3 class="aboutme-subtitle">Skills</h3>

          <li>Linux &dash; I have used Linux operating systems since 2014 and have a solid grasp of day-to-day use and
            the underlying
            structure of the operating system. I am confident using the command line. My preferred distributions are
            Arch, which I have
            installed manually on a number of occasions, or Manjaro as my daily driver.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3 class="aboutme-subtitle">Hobbies and Interests</h3>
        <p class="aboutme-text">I enjoy good seasonal food, literature and music. I enjoy opera, particularly the works
          of Benjamin Britten
          and Jean-Philippe Rameau. I highly regard the music of James Brown, Fela Kuti and Johnny Osbourne.
          I have a passion for silent cinema, in particular the works of Max Linder, Abel Gance, FW Murnau and Fritz
          Lang. If I had to take one film to a desert island, however, it would be 'Menschen am Sonntag' by Siodmak and
          Ulmer.
          My favourite modern directors are Luis Bu&ntilde;uel, Joseph Losey and &Eacute;ric Rohmer. <br><br>My
          favourite of Shakespeare's plays
          is Henry IV, Part 1. As a labour of love, I translated Guillaume de Lorris's portion of the Roman de la Rose
          into rhyming tetrametric
          couplets. I enjoy cycling, weightlifting and problem solving. Having taught English in Naples and Messina over
          the course of two years,
          I have a strong, though now somewhat rusty, knowledge of Italian, and a good knowledge of written French. I am
          currently reading Don Quixote.
